# [Munro Bagger](https://munro-bagger-cca2f.web.app/)

Munro Bagger is a fully responsive web application that allows an authenticated user to track and store different mountains (over 3000ft) climbed around Scotland, known as munros. This app utilises a variety of APIs including munro details and map locations, integrates map technology from tom-tom, authentication and a firebase backend for data storage. The app also aloows the user to filter groups of munros by region, to show which mountains are clustered together.

This responsive project was created by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is hosted on Firebase.
